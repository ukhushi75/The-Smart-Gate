# The Smart Gate 
This smart gate project is used to ensure that only authorized cars enter a parking lot. As the car approaches the gate, an Ultra-sonic sensor is used to detect the presence of the car. The driver is then directed to enter the pre-defined passcode from the user, and if the passcode is right. the servo motors are activated and gates are opened. 
If the input is wrong, the LEDs in the board would be turned on and the buzzer would be activated.
